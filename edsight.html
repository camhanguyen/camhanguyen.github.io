                <p>To tackle these challenges, our team took a co-design approach, where we involved partner educators and researchers in

                <h2>Insight: A Design Vignette</h2>

                <h3>Developing opportunities for deeper data sensemaking for educators</h3>
                <p>Over two years of conducting cognitive interviews with teachers and instructional coaches,
                  we observed that when presented with classroom data about student engagement,
                  teachers tended to recall instructional moves and attribute causes, but rarely demonstrated actionable insight (Campos et al., under review).</p>
                <p>We saw an opportunity to enrich teachers' experience with Edsight, to develop more actionable conjectures about learning and teaching,
                  when our partners came to us with a request for a new measure: to capture student experience at the Launch of a Math instructional task.</p>
                <p>We built from partners' insights that different from the other practical measures focusing on group or whole-class representation, this new task should also feature individual perspective.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>I proposed a new experience for teachers to view student data.
                  The new features are shifts (1) from aggregate to individual view, and (2) from static to dynamic representations. This experience has three main benefits:</p>
                <li>Teachers can quickly scan at the individual (by row) and the class levels (by color patterns).</li>
                <li>Teachers can set a threshold for viewing student patterns (i.e., as answering "Yes" to being ready for the tasks >60% of the time)
                  and develop hypotheses about how and why certain subgroups of students may differ from one another in learning experiences.</li>
                <li>Giving teachers the choice to switch over aggregate/individual, single-day/multi-day, and thresholds of data patterns contributes to enhancing their agency in learning analytics.</li>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/edsight_threshold.png">
                <small>I created a widget for teachers to select thresholds for the data patterns, building different hypotheses about student engagement with the launch of a task.</small>

                <small>Teachers can quickly view individual learning patterns (left side) and aggregate views (bar graphs and word clusters) over time (right).</small>
