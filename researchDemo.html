                <i>My research applies data sciences and design research approaches to examine the learning values in multiparty systems; for example, in crowdsourcing, social media communication, and collaborative chatbot systems.</i>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Study 1: Integrating learning opportunities in crowdsourcing</h3>
                <p>The prospect of applying crowdsourcing to labeling and processing data at scale is emerging in Education.</p>
                <p>A key opportunity is the use of crowdsourcing to process formative assessments, examples of which include homework or student surveys. Teachers administer these assessments frequently, but may not have the time to grade and return detailed feedback to students.</p>
                <p>In <a href = "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386527.3406734" target="_blank">this study</a>, I examined the feasibility of applying crowdsourcing to score student essays that display scientific thinking. Scoring assessments can be difficult because it requires a certain level of domain knowledge.</p>
                <p>Importantly, I took an equity lens to consider whether individuals participating in the crowdsourcing tasks can learn from the experience. </p>
                <h4>Contributions</h4>
                <p>I integrated knowledge from the learning sciences to devise different conditions for the crowdsourcing tasks, e.g., asking individuals to only grade assessments versus grade and explain their reasoning for the scores.</p>
                <p>Findings about the reliability of crowdsourcing and the learning potential of the task suggest the promise of using crowdsourcing to process educational assessments.</p>
                <p><strong>With this assessment, using crowdsourcing can cut the processing cost by half</strong>.</p>
                <p><b>Applicability to Twitter:</b> With its large user base, Twitter already offers natural opportunities for users to crowdsource ideas. This particular study poses additional questions about how we can facilitate these processes, how we can measure the impact of such crowdsourcing tasks,
                  and the learning that users who participate in these crowdsourcing tasks can acquire.</p>

                <p>You can find the R codes for the paper <a href = "researchBrief/learnerSource_codeDemo.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>In a recent paper, I have extended this work to another crowdsourcing context (literacy assessments), with a different learning design for the crowdsourcing tasks. The paper will be presented at the Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK'21). The paper can be found <a href="https://camps.aptaracorp.com/ACM_PMS/PMS/ACM/LAK21/7/7b822046-6192-11eb-8d84-166a08e17233/OUT/lak21-7.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Study 2: School district social media communication in a time of crisis</h3>
                <p>In my recent work, I looked at leveraging large-scale, publicly available data such as Facebook communication, to understand how school districts in the United States communicated about the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                <p>I illustrated how to use the content of the districts' posts in neural network models to predict when a district first closed in March. I evaluated the accuracy of several models (e.g., feed-forward NN, LSTM, CNN) against different validation metrics.</p>
                <h4>Contributions</h4>
                <p>While prior analyses have revealed the general trends in social media use among school districts,
                  such analyses do not illuminate the finer-grained details about how districts disseminate important information regarding school closure, reopening, and resource dissemination in real time.
                  This dissemination may vary with districts’ locations (e.g., in areas with a high versus low number of COVID cases), state policies, resource availability, and individual district’s decision-making.
                  This study is a first step towards analyzing the content of district posts at scale, to reveal relevant messages regarding public agency's communication in times of crisis.</p>
                <p><b>Applicability to Twitter:</b> Understanding the trends and content in social media posts for organizations with large public outreach can help Twitter to build notification and trending pages that maximize informational gains and social impacts.</p>
                <p>Here's a <a href="researchBrief/Nguyen_District FB Communication.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a> of the paper, to be submitted to the American Education Research Association conference.</p>
                <p>The Python code for the paper is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iNxKQKIYZ7czHnW7_OMtJ5GnUcU9SM-p?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Ongoing projects I'm excited about</h3>
                <p>A main strand of my research focuses on human-computer interaction and design research, combining A/B testing with insights from interviews, focus groups, and co-design with stakeholders such as teachers, students, and researchers.
                  Currently, for my dissertation project, I am designing a collaborative chatbot that can adapt its personalities (as a peer or a mentor) to different users.
                  The project reaches 2000 students per year in partnership with a local state park in OC.</p>
